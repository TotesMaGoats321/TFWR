This repository contains all used code pretaining to the game "The Farmer was Replaced."

Currently, farming the basic resources Wheat, Carrots, and Wood will be located in the "First Game" folder

For the more complex materials (pumpkins, sunflowers, wheat, etc) they will each get their own folder
